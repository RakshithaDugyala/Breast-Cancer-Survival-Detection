This Jupyter Notebook focuses on detecting breast cancer survival outcomes using machine learning techniques. The primary objective of this analysis is to predict whether a patient with breast cancer is likely to survive beyond a certain period, based on various medical features. The dataset used in this notebook includes clinical data such as age at diagnosis, tumor size, number of positive axillary lymph nodes, and survival status, among other features. These attributes serve as input variables for predictive modeling.

The project begins with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the nature of the dataset. Key statistics, missing values, and the distribution of variables are examined and visualized to derive meaningful patterns. This helps in identifying imbalanced classes and understanding relationships between features and survival outcomes. Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features are applied to prepare the data for modeling.

Following EDA, the notebook implements a series of classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each model is trained using the preprocessed dataset and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are also plotted to visualize the effectiveness of each model. Cross-validation techniques are applied to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models.

The notebook concludes by comparing the performance of all implemented models and identifying the best-performing approach for breast cancer survival prediction. Additionally, it provides recommendations for model deployment and future work, such as hyperparameter tuning, using deep learning methods, or integrating additional clinical features. This project is a valuable demonstration of how machine learning can contribute to critical healthcare problems, offering clinicians a data-driven approach to prognosis and treatment planning.
